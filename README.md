# weather-utils

This crate includes a set of common and useful weather-related computations,
such as the temperature unit conversions, computations of humidity/temperature
related values (absolute humidity, dew point, heat index), computations of
barometric pressure related values (altitude)...

If a computation you need is not present, please feel free to ask for it, or
even better contribute it ;-)

## Features

- [x] Conversion from 째C to 째F.
